## Projects:
### Predictive Modeling for Day-Ahead Pricing in Electricity Markets

Using information from the generation market for Colombia, we developed machine learning and deep learning architectures to forecast spot pricing (kWh/$COP) at each timestamp by plant. Our approach included advanced algorithms like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) over baseline (ARIMA) models. We compared their performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared. The project demonstrated significant, consistent improvements in predictive accuracy. This work underscores the potential for predictive modeling to enhance decision making in real-life scenarios.

### Spatial Analysis of Lip Cancer Incidence within Scotland

Employing the SpatialEpi dataset to explore lip cancer recurrence in Scottish counties, we investigate potential correlations with agricultural workforces, building on previous epidemiological findings. This contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the disease's regional dynamics and how it varied across different regions.
