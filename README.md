## Projects:
### Predictive Modeling for Day-Ahead Pricing in Electricity Markets - 2023

Using information from the generation market for Colombia, we developed machine learning and deep learning architectures to forecast spot pricing (kWh/$COP) at each timestamp by plant. Our approach included advanced algorithms like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) over baseline (ARIMA) models. We compared their performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared. The project demonstrated significant, consistent improvements in predictive accuracy. This work underscores the potential for predictive modeling to enhance decision making in real-life scenarios.

### Spatial Analysis of Lip Cancer Incidence within Scotland - 2023

Employing the SpatialEpi dataset to explore lip cancer recurrence in Scottish counties, we investigate potential correlations with agricultural workforces, building on previous epidemiological findings. This contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the disease's regional dynamics and how it varied across different regions.

### Enhanced Option Valuation Using Deep Learning - 2024

Building on classic valuation models such as Black-Scholes-Merton, we utilize the predictive capabilities of RNNs to enhance year-over-year predicitions over financial statements (current).
