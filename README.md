## Projects:
### Predictive Modeling for Day-Ahead Pricing in Electricity Markets - 2023

Using information from the generation market for Colombia, we developed machine learning and deep learning architectures to forecast spot pricing (kWh/$COP) at each timestamp by plant. Our approach included advanced algorithms like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) over baseline (ARIMA) models. We compared their performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared. The project demonstrated significant, consistent improvements in predictive accuracy. This work underscores the potential for predictive modeling to enhance decision making in real-life scenarios.

### Spatial Analysis of Lip Cancer Incidence within Scotland - 2023

Employing the SpatialEpi dataset to explore lip cancer recurrence in Scottish counties, we investigate potential correlations with agricultural workforces, building on previous epidemiological findings. This contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the disease's regional dynamics and how it varied across different regions.

### Enhanced Option Valuation Using Deep Learning - 2024

We explored the frontier of real options valuation in the energy industry by integrating deep learning techniques with traditional financial models. This research aimed to enhance the accuracy of cash flow predictions and their applicability of real option valuation, focusing on the dynamic uncertainties of the energy sector. We developed advanced machine learning architectures to capture complex temporal dependencies in financial data. These models were compared against traditional methods like ARIMA, demonstrating significant improvements in predictive accuracy across metrics such as RMSE and R-squared. The application of these predictions in real options valuation scenarios using the Black-Scholes-Merton model highlighted the practical benefits of our approach with little information space. This work highlights the potential of combining deep learning with financial models to optimize investment decisions in volatile markets​.
